1   introduction
----------------

    spblob is a software for quantification of stained semen patches on certain
    test papers.

    usage: spblob [--save-start N] [--raw RAW] [--stat STAT]
                  [--scale SCALE] [--size SIZE] [--proximal PROX] [--distal DIST]

    spblob [conventional]: detect intensity parameters from semen patches on test
    papers. this software does not rely on neural network model. but entirely by
    traditional image segmentation with a watershed-like algorithm.

      -a, --stat            location of the statistics summary file. (stats.tsv)
      -d, --dir             input be a directory of images in *.jpg.
      -f, --fas             filename as sample, accept the file name of the image as
                            the sample name without prompting the user to enter the
                            sample names manually.
      -l, --raw             location of the output raw data file. (raw.tsv)
      -n, --save-start      starting index of the output dataset clips. (0)
      -o, --output          dataset output directory. must exist prior to running
      -p, --proximal        proximal detetion position. (270.0)
      -s, --size            resolution for the final image. stating that every 1 unit
                            in --scale should represent 60px in the dataset image. (60.0)
      -t, --distal          distal detetion position. (300.0)
      -x, --scale           the relative scale factor of the output dataset clips 
                            (the image dataset for later neural-network based detection
                            routine. this takes the perpendicular edge length of
                            the positioning triangle to be unified into fold changes
                            from 10px. the default value requires that for each output
                            image, the positioning triangle should have an edge length
                            of 26px. (2.6)
      -y, --posang-size     the minimal size of the positioning angle. (50)
      -z, --posang-thresh   the red visual intensity threshold for the positioning angle. (40)
      -?, --help            give this help list.
          --usage           give a short usage message.
      -V, --version         print program version.

    mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
    for any corresponding short options.
