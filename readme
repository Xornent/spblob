                                    ======

1   introduction
----------------

    spblob is a software for quantification of stained semen patches on certain
    test papers.


2   usage
---------

    usage: spblob [option...]
                [--save-start N] [--raw RAW] [--stat STAT] [--scale SCALE] [--size
                SIZE] [--proximal PROX] [--distal DIST] [-o OUTPUT] [-d] [-f] INPUT

    spblob [conventional]: detect intensity parameters from semen patches on test
    papers. this software does not rely on neural network model. but entirely by
    traditional image segmentation with a watershed-like algorithm.
    
      -a, --stat=stat            location of the statistics summary file (stats.tsv)
      -d, --dir                  input be a directory of images in *.jpg
      -f, --fas                  filename as sample, accept the file name of the
                                 image as the sample name without prompting the
                                 user to enter the sample names manually
      -l, --raw=RAW              location of the output raw data file (raw.tsv)
      -n, --save-start=N         starting index of the output dataset clips (0)
      -o, --output=OUTPUT        dataset output directory. must exist prior to
                                 running
      -p, --proximal=PROX        proximal detetion position (270.0)
      -s, --size=SIZE            resolution for the final image. stating that every
                                 1 unit in --scale should represent 60px in the
                                 dataset image. (60.0)
      -t, --distal=DIST          distal detetion position (300.0)
      -x, --scale=SCALE          the relative scale factor of the output dataset
                                 clips (the image dataset for later neural-network
                                 based detection routine. this takes the
                                 perpendicular edge length of the positioning
                                 triangle to be unified into fold changes from
                                 10px. the default value requires that for each
                                 output image, the positioning triangle should have
                                 an edge length of 26px.) (2.6)
      -?, --help                 give this help list
          --usage                give a short usage message
      -v, --version              print program version
    
    mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
    for any corresponding short options.
